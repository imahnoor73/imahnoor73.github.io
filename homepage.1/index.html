<h>The Corner Seat</h>
<p>New York to the outside world is a place composed of millions of people, a place known as Time Square and the Empire State Building. In reality it is what you make of what belongs there, as to some it could be a spot to eat, a park, or even an abandoned place. My New York consists of several memories and places that are extremely significant and close to my heart. The main place that I always think of when thinking of New York is the Dunkin Donuts near my house by the train station.</p>
<p>I came across this comforting place around five or six years ago. It was during the moment of my life when  I was entering the most hectic part of my life. I was in my preteen years. I was going through all sorts of changes which included mental, physical and emotional changes. In middle school, I was becoming more dependent on myself and started to be more social with my friends. This location was very tiny. This location was compact. This location was quite small in size in comparison to others. This location had a connection. This location had me comfortable and at ease. You would find me there either by myself or with company. I had a place where I would feel comfortable allowing myself to develop into a strong tennager. I became more independent and utilized the space as a get away from the rush hour in the city. I could just be myself. As well as being able to have coffee, or hot chocolate in the winter time would just make it seem like my personal outing. </p>
<p>As time goes on, I find myself traveling an hour away from home, since I was beginning high school. High school came with its struggles of becoming more vulnerable, as I was stepping into a place filled with all the unknowns. Unfamiliar places and people had caught me off guard, as I wasn't mentally prepared for such a huge transition. Hence why I needed something to make my own, to feel a part of me, and at that exact moment I realized the impact Dunkin would have on me. From that day on, Dunkin became something I implemented into my life, and made room for it. I would leave my house a couple of minutes before the train would get to the platform, so that I would have enough time to stop by and grab a coffee. Even after school, I would stop by, especially on days when I feel extremely overwhelmed and need a space to talk to myself and recollect everything that was happening in my life. My friends and I since middle school, would meet up there as it was a ritual for us, allowing us to clear anything on our minds that was bothering us. </p>
<p>At this point in my life, I question what I would do, if I hadn't discovered this comforting spot. And keep in mind, I don’t feel this way at any other Dunkin Donuts location or any other place that others may feel comfort from. For instance, being at a library may provide someone comfort that I can never feel at the library. As the library is just a place for me, where I can go to find books or to just sit and do work.  On the other hand, Dunkin provides me the comfort that nothing and no one else can. Since, it is me there allowing only comments from those who I can trust and who love me, it’s just space built for me to be my true self.  We wear this mask in certain situations just to feel included, and as someone who has experienced this  I can assure it can lead to extremely low self esteem. This will remain here for many years to come, as it will become a New York for many others to experience and to build a connection with. </p>
